# Classification_Logistic_Regression

1) Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) is a modeling technique in chemoinformatics used in pharmacology and chemistry.
2) QSAR aims to relate the chemical structure of molecules and their biological or chemical activity through mathematical models.
3) QSAR models establish mathematical correlations between molecular structural descriptors and their biological/chemical properties.
4) The dataset used is open source, that contains QSAR information along with the biodegradability status of 1,055 chemicals.
5) Each row in the dataset represents a single chemical.
6) a) The first 41 columns represent features that describe each chemical.
   b) The final column is the data label - 1 for biodegradable, 0 indicates non-biodegradable
